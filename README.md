## Description
This is Hot Restaurant.  It is from Chapter 11, Excercise 15 of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp.  It is a simple Node.js Express application, also deployed to Heroku, that allows a user to add reservations to the system.  If the restaurant is full (five reservations) it then spills over to the wait list.  By default, it has four example reservations already loaded.  But, they can be cleared anytime on the View Tables page with the 'Clear Table' option at the bottom.
